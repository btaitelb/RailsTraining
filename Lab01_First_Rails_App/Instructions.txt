Lab 01 - Creating Your First Rails App
======================================

Pre-Lab
-------

1. Review Unix Navigation Commands.
   (pages 7-8 in slides handout)

2. What do the following commands do?

cd ~
mkdir testing
cd testing
touch file.txt
ls
cd ..
rm -rf testing


Part I - Create a New App
-------------------------

1. Open a terminal (command prompt) and navigate to this directory. Note that you don't have to type out the full directory name, just type Lab01 and hit the TAB key to autocomplete.

  cd /c/Code/Lab01_[TAB]

2. Create a new rails app called fridge_door

  rails new fridge_door

3. Look at the output of that last command. It created a bunch of files and then ran a command. What command did it run, and what do you think this command does?

4. Go into the newly created directory. What files and directories were created for you?

  cd fridge_door
  ls

5. Create the initial database

  rake db:create

6. Launch the rails app

  rails server

7. It might take 20 seconds for the rails server to load up on this windows virtual machine, so wait until you see output like:

=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.2.5.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
[2016-04-17 23:07:13] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2016-04-17 23:07:13] INFO  ruby 2.2.4 (2015-12-16) [i386-mingw32]
[2016-04-17 23:07:13] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=4856 port=3000


8. Open up a browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see your site.

Congrats! You just built your first rails app!
Now let's make it actually do something...


Part II - Scaffold a Note resource
----------------------------------

9. Stop the rails server by typing Ctrl+C
   Note: you can also leave this running and open up another terminal window. Just be sure to navigate to the same rails app (in c:\Code\Lab01_First_Rails_App/fridge_door)

10. Let rails generate all the files we need to represent a simple Note. Notes will have a title and a body. The title will be a short string (255 characters or less), while the body will be text of an arbitrary length.

  rails generate scaffold note title:string body:text

11. What files did that create?

12. Since it created a database migration, we need to update our dateabse

  rake db:migrate

13. Launch the rails server

 (hint: you did this previously in step 6)

14. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/notes

15. Create your first note with the following fields

  Title: your name
  Body:  3 sentences:
           1. What's your favorite website?
           2. What's your favorite computer program?
           3. What are you hoping to get out of this course?

16. Let the instructor know you're done.

17. See if you can help any of your neighbors.


Extra Credit
------------

18. Make the notes show up when you visit the root path of http://localhost:3000
 - see the comments in config/routes.rb to see if you can figure out to do this.

19. Create a new rails app to practice what you just learned. How about an app named "blog" that has a resource named "post"?


Post-Lab
--------

* Introduce ourselves to the class by sharing our notes.
* Save what we did as a check point

  # see what changes we've made
  git status

  # add everything we want to commit
  git add fridge_door Instructions.txt

  # commit our changes to the local git database
  git commit -m 'Finishes Lab01'
