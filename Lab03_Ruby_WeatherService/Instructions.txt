Lab 3 - Ruby Bootcamp
=====================

In this lab, we're exploring the ruby language itself, without any
rails. We'll learn the syntax, fundamental concepts like arrays,
blocks and objects, and will develop a library that we're going to use
later in our rails app.

Pre-Lab
-------

* Slides 46-61
* Ruby classes in animal.rb


Part I - Weather Model
----------------------

1. Run the tests in weather_tests.rb
2. What's failing? Look at the code for the failing tests.
3. Implement the missing functionality in weather.rb so that the tests
   pass.


Part II - Weather Service
-------------------------

You've been provided the file weather_service.rb that's gets weather
data from openweathermap.org. We want to take that data and convert it
into our Weather object, but currently the "weather" method isn't
returning the results we want.

By default, if you instantiate the WeatherService without any
constructor arguments, then it will be in debug mode. This is what we
want, so that it doesn't contact the API. Otherwise, we might go over
our rate limit.

1. Take a look at the code in weather_service.rb. What does it do?
2. Create a new file weather_service_tests.rb and write some tests for
the weather method. These tests should fail to indicate where our
method is broken.
3. Fix the weather method so that the tests pass.
4. Show the instructor your passing tests, and get the API key.
5. Test against the actual weather service.


Post-Lab
--------

- Commit your code changes
- Discussion: How are you feeling about ruby? What do you like / dislike / find confusing?
